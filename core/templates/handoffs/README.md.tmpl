# Session handoffs

This directory is how work is carried across Claude Code sessions while keeping
each session's context light.

- `current.md` — always points at (contains) the latest handoff. `CLAUDE.md`
  imports this path, and the SessionStart hook auto-loads it when its `status` is
  not `done`.
- `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<slug>.md` — individual dated handoffs.
- `archive/` — superseded handoffs (gitignored by default).

## Writing a handoff
Run `/fable-handoff` before you stop. It summarizes what changed, writes a new
dated handoff, and repoints `current.md`.

## Resuming
Just start a new session — the latest handoff loads automatically. To reload it
manually mid-session, run `/fable-resume`.

## The handoff contract
A good handoff is short (<120 lines) and contains: the carved **Goal**, what's
**Done**, the ordered **Next** steps, **Open questions/blockers**, **Context
pointers** (the few files worth reading), and a **Do NOT** list.
