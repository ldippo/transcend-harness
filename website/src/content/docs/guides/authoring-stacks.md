description: How to add a stack profile — the profile YAML, detection signals and scoring, and validation.

<!-- adapted from docs/AUTHORING-STACKS.md -->

A stack profile maps detection signals to concrete defaults: which pillar options get pre-selected, which commands fill the `{vars}` in fragments, and which [catalog entries](../../reference/catalog/) are recommended. Profiles contain NO templates.

## 1. Write `core/stacks/<id>.yaml`

Follow `core/stacks/_schema.yaml`. Model on `node-ts-react.yaml` (frontend) or `python-fastapi.yaml` / `go-service.yaml` (services). Requirements:

- `id` matches the filename stem; it is what the detector emits.
- Every `vars` key in the schema must be present, even if `""` (the generator substitutes them blindly into fragments). `pkg_run` is the optional env-runner prefix (`"uv run"`, `"poetry run"`) for ecosystems where commands run inside a managed environment.
- `src_globs`/`test_globs` feed rule `paths:` frontmatter — they decide when rules auto-load, so keep them tight (no bare `**/*`).
- `pillar_defaults` must name existing option ids from each `core/pillars/<pillar>/pillar.yaml`.
- `catalog_recommend` ids must exist in `core/catalog/catalog.yaml` — a stack with no relevant entries gets an empty (skipped) catalog question, which is fine, but check whether an existing entry applies before leaving it empty.

## 2. Add detection

1. **Signal probe** — `core/detectors/signals.<lang>.sh` (new file per language, reused across that language's profiles). POSIX sh, read-only, prints `key=value` lines. Cheap substring greps over manifests (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, …) — no parsers, no network, no toolchain invocation. Resolve the package manager from lockfiles here.
2. **Scoring** — in `core/detectors/detect.sh`: source the probe, read its signals via `sig`, compute an integer 0–100 score (strong = 90, plausible = 60–70, absent = 0), add the profile to the candidate list in the python emitter, and extend the pick-highest chain. Keep tie-breaks stable and document them in the comment.
3. **Signals into JSON** — add the new `key=value`s to the emitted `signals` object; catalog `triggers` match against these keys.

## 3. Test it

Add scenarios to `tests/test-detect.sh`: one strong-signal fixture, one weak-signal fixture, and (if the language can coexist with others) a polyglot fixture asserting the tie-break. Run `sh tests/test-detect.sh`.

## 4. Sanity-check generation

Run the interview against a scratch project of the new stack: detection confidence, batch A wording, command-var reconciliation (`has_*_script`-style signals must exist for any command the profile assumes), and that every fragment placeholder resolves.
